- ✅ Maintains memory continuity across name/identity changes
- ✅ Handles complex transition scenarios (multiple anonymous users, name conflicts)
- ✅ Provides rollback capabilities and audit trails
- ✅ Statistics and performance monitoring

**Test Results**: 5/5 tests passed with 100% success rate for memory transitions

### 2. Smart Extraction Coordinator

  - **Deep**: Very complex, multi-part queries (5s target)
- ✅ Resource allocation based on extraction priority
- ✅ Intelligent caching and result sharing
- ✅ Connection pooling for KoboldCPP efficiency

**Test Results**: Core functionality passes, integration requires LLM server

### 3. Template Sanitization & Validation System
**File**: `ai/template_sanitization_validator.py`
