I found several critical issues with the current implementation of the Universal Memory Extraction System while testing it:

## Major Issues Found:
1. **Hallucination of People**: The system incorrectly extracts "Francesco" in the McDonald's visit when no person was mentioned in the input "I went to McDonald earlier today."

2. **Excessive LLM Calls**: The system makes 5+ separate TIER 3 extractions (300 tokens each) plus TIER 2 extractions, using over 1,650 tokens for a simple 7-word statement.

3. **Performance Issues**: Extremely slow response times - first token in 90+ seconds, total processing time over 3 minutes.

4. **JSON Validation Failures**: Every extraction attempt fails with the same error: `[ComprehensiveExtractor] ⚠️ JSON validation failed: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 5 column 26 (char 75)`

5. **Massive Prompt Templates**: Extraction prompts are ~866 tokens each, which is inefficient and includes example data like "Francesco" that contaminates the results.

## Recommended Fixes:

1. **Reduce Template Size**: Remove the hardcoded examples from prompts that include "McDonald's visit with Francesco" - this is leaking into results.

2. **Implement Pattern-First Approach**: Simple statements like "I went to McDonald earlier today" should use pattern matching rather than LLM extraction.

3. **Fix JSON Handling**: Improve error handling for JSON validation failures.

4. **Limit Redundant Extractions**: Implement proper coordination to prevent multiple extraction attempts for the same content.

5. **Optimize Fallback Logic**: The LLM should only be used as a backup when pattern recognition truly fails.

I'm happy to contribute code to fix these issues if needed.
